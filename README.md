# FAR_MountainGuide_UI

@author: Pat McGee

This script scrapes the Fernie Alpine Resort Webpage for the current lift/bowl status, weather and snow conditions Every time it sees a change within operating hours it stores the information in the far_data database, wherever that is defined.

The goal is to use this information to:

Make better decisions on where the best snow will be,
Eventually try and predict zone oipenings using AI and historical data
